Tired of chopping trees or mining ores one block at a time?  
**Dorios Excavate** introduces a smarter, faster, and achievement-friendly way to dig through Minecraft Bedrock.

---

## Smarter Mining

This addon reimagines how players mine and gather resources.  
Instead of breaking blocks one by one, Excavate lets you instantly mine entire **veins**, **trees**, or **tunnels** — all while keeping lag to a minimum.

Each block is processed with a short delay to maintain smooth performance even during large excavations, making it ideal for both survival and multiplayer servers.

---

## Full Control, Your Way

Every player can fully customize their excavation experience:

- Add or remove blocks from your whitelist  
- Toggle the excavate ability on or off  
- Change your **Shape Mode** (Line, Tunnel, Vein, etc.)  
- Adjust your **Block Limit** for performance and balance

## Works With Achievements

One of Dorios Excavate’s strongest features is its **compatibility with achievements**.  
That means you can use it in your survival worlds without disabling Xbox Live achievements — making it perfect for both casual and competitive players.

---

## Performance-Focused

Unlike traditional vein miners, Dorios Excavate was designed to be **lag-friendly**.  
By spreading block-breaking operations over short intervals, it ensures stable tick performance even when excavating massive areas.
