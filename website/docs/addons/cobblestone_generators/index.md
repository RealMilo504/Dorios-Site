# Cobblestone Generators

Tired of mining for cobblestone? Well, not anymore — UtilityCraft introduces **Cobblestone Generators**,  
a simple yet powerful way to produce unlimited cobblestone automatically.

---

## Overview

There are **5 tiers** of Cobblestone Generators:
**Iron**, **Gold**, **Emerald**, **Diamond**, and **Netherite**.  
Each tier increases production speed, allowing faster and more efficient cobble generation.

  />
</p>

## Crafting the Generator

To get started, craft the **first-tier generator** using the recipe below.  
You can later upgrade it all the way up to **Netherite** (requires Netherite Scrap).

<p align="center">
  <img

    alt="Cobblestone Generator Recipe" 
    width="70%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

Upgrading the generator is done through crafting —  
place the previous tier in the center, surrounded by the next material.

    width="70%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

## How It Works

Each generator has a **conduit port** on one side — this indicates where items are output.  
Place a **container** (like a chest or barrel) in front of that side to collect the cobblestone.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/cobblestone_generator_output.jpg" 
    alt="Cobblestone Generator Output Example" 
    width="70%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

They can be placed facing **any direction**, giving flexibility for automation setups.  
If no container is connected, the generator can hold up to **64 cobblestones** internally,  
and you can collect them by hand.

## Generator Tiers

| Tier       | Speed (Cobblestone per Second) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Iron        | 0.5                           |
| Gold        | 1                             |
| Emerald     | 2                             |
| Diamond     | 4                             |
| Netherite   | 20                            |

The **higher the tier**, the faster the generator.  
The last tier produces cobblestone so quickly that you’ll soon need better storage solutions.

## Compressed Cobblestone

When storage becomes a problem, you can use **Compressed Cobblestone**.  
It allows you to save space by combining 9 cobblestones into 1 compressed version —  
and you can **compress up to 9 times**!

    alt="Compressed Cobblestone Examples" 
    width="70%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

| Example | Recipe | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Compressing | 9 Cobblestone | 1 Compressed Cobblestone |
| Decompressing | 1 Compressed Cobblestone | 9 Cobblestone |

    width="70%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/decompressed_cobblestone_recipe.jpg" 
    alt="Decompressing Cobblestone" 
    width="70%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

Compressing cobblestone helps reduce clutter and manage large-scale production efficiently.  
If you reach **nonuple compressed cobblestone**, you’ve processed over **43 million** blocks — good luck getting there!

With automated generation and compression, you’ve reached full control over stone production.  
Next, it’s time to move toward **energy systems** and **machine automation** in UtilityCraft.
