  Excavate – Mine Smarter, Not Harder. Excavate introduces a smarter way to dig, mine, and chop in Minecraft Bedrock without breaking the vanilla balance or disabling achievements. 
  This add-on lets you break entire ore veins, tree clusters, or tunnels in one go, maintaining a stable tick performance by processing blocks progressively. 
  Players can fully customize which blocks are affected, define the maximum excavation range, and select from multiple mining shapes like Line, Tunnel, or Vein modes. 
  Excavate is designed to feel like an official vanilla feature — lightweight, configurable, and multiplayer-safe — making it the perfect quality-of-life addition for both survival and technical players.
