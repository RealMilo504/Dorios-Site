  Bountiful Trees — Grow ores, not just wood. This Minecraft Bedrock addon introduces ore-based trees that combine mining and farming into one balanced system. 
  Each tree grows naturally, drops its own saplings, and produces ores when harvested. It’s designed to expand resource gathering without breaking vanilla progression or performance balance.

**Bountiful Trees** introduces a new way to gather resources in Minecraft Bedrock — by growing them.  
This addon lets you cultivate trees made of ores, minerals, and gems, turning your farms into renewable sources of valuable materials while keeping a natural and immersive look.  
It blends farming and mining into a single, balanced progression system.

## How It Works

Each ore tree begins from a **special sapling** crafted with the mineral it represents.  
Once planted, it grows into a tree with a **mineral-infused trunk** and **custom ore leaves**.  
When fully grown, breaking the trunk yields both **logs** and **ores**, offering a decorative and practical alternative to mining.

Ore trees grow just like vanilla saplings:
- They can grow naturally over time  
- Or be instantly grown using **Bone Meal**

No special tools or machines are required — simply plant, wait, and harvest.

## Crafting Ore Saplings

Each ore sapling is crafted using:

- 1x Oak Sapling  
- 8x of the corresponding mineral

  />
</p>

For example:

| Sapling | Recipe | Output |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Iron Sapling** | 1 Oak Sapling + 8 Iron Ingots | Iron Ore Tree |
| **Diamond Sapling** | 1 Oak Sapling + 8 Diamonds | Diamond Ore Tree |
| **Gold Sapling** | 1 Oak Sapling + 8 Gold Ingots | Gold Ore Tree |

These recipes make ore trees a mid-to-late game feature, rewarding exploration and offering renewable ore production later on.

## Growth and Harvest

Ore trees feature trunks made of **ore logs** and **unique leaves** matching their mineral type.  
These leaves behave like vanilla ones, meaning they drop **ore saplings**, allowing continuous replanting and expansion.  

Breaking an ore tree’s trunk provides:
- Regular oak logs (as from normal trees)  
- Ores or minerals depending on the sapling type  

Any standard tool can be used — harvesting is simple, familiar, and rewarding.

## UtilityCraft Compatibility

Bountiful Trees will soon feature full integration with **UtilityCraft**, allowing:
- Compact ore farming through **Bonsai Pots**  
- Automation of harvesting and processing with **UtilityCraft Machines**  
- Full energy-based systems powered by **Dorios Energy (DE)**  

This compatibility will make the addon ideal for both survival and technical players, offering natural progression and automation opportunities.
