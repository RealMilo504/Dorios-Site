# Bountiful Bonsais

**Bountiful Bonsais** is a lightweight addon designed to make your life easier by automating the production of basic natural resources — such as **wood**, **plants**, and **crops** — without breaking survival balance.

Instead of farming manually, you can grow small **bonsai trees** that passively generate drops over time.  
Each bonsai can be customized with **different soils, trees, and crops**, affecting both the growth speed and type of resources produced.

Once placed, it will automatically begin producing items every growth cycle.
