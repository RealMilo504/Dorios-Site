# Crafting and Setup

Before your bonsai can start producing resources, youâ€™ll first need to craft a **Bonsai Pot** and understand how it works.

---

## Crafting the Bonsai Pot

The **Bonsai Pot** is the core block of the addon.  
It acts as the growing platform where all bonsais are planted.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/bonsais/recipe_bonsai.jpg" 
    alt="Bonsai Pot Crafting Recipe" 
    width="60%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

**Recipe:**
- 3 Ã— **Stone Slabs**  
- 1 Ã— **Hopper**  
- 2 Ã— **Planks**  

Once crafted, itâ€™s ready to be placed anywhere.

## Placing and Using the Bonsai

Place your bonsai **on top of a container**, such as a **Chest** or **Barrel**.  
This allows it to automatically store all generated items â€” no hopper is required.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/bonsais/bonsai_on_barrel_and_chest.jpg" 
    alt="Bonsai placed on barrel and chest" 
    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

Each bonsai collects its drops directly in the block beneath it.  
You can use any container that supports item storage, including UtilityCraft blocks.

---

## Soil Setup

Every bonsai requires a **soil** to grow.  
Different soils affect **growth speed** and **compatibility** with plants.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/bonsais/soils_row.jpg" 
    alt="All soil types for bonsais" 
    width="85%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

### Growth Speed Modifiers

| Soil Type | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Dirt / Grass | Normal growth |
| Red Sand / Sand | 10s faster |
| Hoed Soil | Additional 10s faster |

Using a **hoe** on soil increases growth speed â€” except on special soils from UtilityCraft or Bountiful Crops, which already have unique properties.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/bonsais/soils_row_farmed.jpg" 
    alt="All soil types for bonsais" 
    width="85%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>
---

## Compatible Soils and Plants

| Soil Type | Compatible Plants |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Dirt / Grass** | Vanilla trees, crops, berries, mushrooms |
| **Sand / Red Sand** | Cactus, Sugar Cane, Kelp |
| **Crimson Nylium** | Crimson Tree |
| **Warped Nylium** | Warped Tree |
| **Endstone** | Chorus Fruit |
| **Soul Sand** | Nether Wart |

The **base growth time** for any bonsai is **60 seconds**, reduced further by certain soils and upgrades.

---

## Planting a Tree

Once youâ€™ve added soil, take a **sapling or seed** and interact with the bonsai to plant it.  
If placed correctly, a **miniature version** of the plant will appear.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/bonsais/planting_sapling.jpg" 
    alt="Planting a sapling in bonsai" 
    width="70%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

Your bonsai will now begin to grow and automatically produce resources.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You donâ€™t need a hopper below the bonsai.  
> It will automatically transfer items to the container beneath it.

---

## Removing or Resetting

You can remove:
- Only the **bonsai** using **shears** (keeps the soil)
- Both **bonsai and soil** by sneaking and breaking it with your hand

---

## Next Steps

Now that your bonsai is producing items, itâ€™s time to understand how **growth mechanics and loot** work â€”  
including drop rates, special soils, and how to fully automate your setup.
