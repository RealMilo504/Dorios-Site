# Growth & Drops

Every bonsai follows a simple cycle: **grow â†’ harvest â†’ repeat**.  
The type of soil, the plant, and certain modifiers directly affect the growth speed and loot outcome.

## Growth Time

By default, each bonsai takes **60 seconds** to complete a full growth cycle.  
However, this time can be reduced with better soils or certain actions.

| Modifier | Effect on Growth |
|:------------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| **Base (any soil)** | 60 seconds |
| **Sand / Red Sand** | -10 seconds |
| **Hoed Soil** | -10 seconds |
| **Special Soils (UtilityCraft)** | Varies per type |
| **Fertilizer / Bone Meal** | Instantly resets progress to full |


Some soils can **multiply** the output or **cut the growth time in half**, depending on their tier.

## Special Soils

When combined with UtilityCraft or Bountiful Crops, you gain access to special soils that greatly boost bonsai performance.  
These soils **cannot be hoed** and each offers unique benefits.

| Soil | Bonus | Loot Multiplier |
|:----------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:----------------:|
| ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow Soil** | Faster growth | Ã—1.5 |
| ðŸ”´ **Red Soil** | Even faster growth | Ã—2 |
| ðŸ”µ **Blue Soil** | Double output | Ã—2 |
| âš« **Black Soil** | Maximum output | Ã—4 |

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Higher-tier soils not only shorten growth time,  
> but also multiply the amount of drops produced by your bonsais.

## Drop Mechanics

Each bonsai generates resources once its growth cycle completes.  
The type and amount of loot depend on the bonsai type, soil, and RNG.

| Bonsai Type | Main Drop | Side Drops | Special Notes |
|:-------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:----------------------:|
| Trees | Logs | Leaves, Sticks, Saplings | Most common bonsai type |
| Crops | Crops / Seeds | â€” | Simple and fast-growing |
| Mushrooms | Mushrooms | â€” | Grows faster in dark |
| Bamboo / Cactus | Plant Items | â€” | Best for bulk farming |
| Chorus / Nether Plants | Rare materials | â€” | Longer growth time |

All drops are automatically inserted into the **container below** the bonsai (Barrel, Chest, or compatible block).  
You can chain multiple containers or connect them with **UtilityCraft hoppers or uppers** for transport.

## Multipliers & Efficiency

Every bonsai calculates its total output like this:

Base Drops Ã— Soil Multiplier

For example:
- A **Dirt Bonsai** might yield 6â€“10 logs.  
- The same bonsai on **Blue Soil** could yield up to 20.  
- On **Black Soil**, it can reach 40 or more per cycle.
