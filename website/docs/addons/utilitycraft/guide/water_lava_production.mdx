# Water & Lava Production

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to produce **Water** and **Lava**, two essential resources for progressing in UtilityCraft.  
These materials unlock early automation, farming, and even Nether access.

## Obtaining Water

Begin by crafting a **Mortar** using 3 Cobblestone and 1 Stone Pebble.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/recipe_mortar.jpg" 
    alt="Mortar Recipe" 
    width="60%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

Use the Mortar along with 1 Glass Bottle and 2 Saplings to create a **Water Bottle**.  
The Mortar won’t be consumed in the process.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/recipe_water_mortar.jpg" 
    alt="Water Bottle Recipe" 
    width="60%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

Once you have **3 Water Bottles**, place a **Cauldron** and use the bottles to fill it.  
When it’s full, use a **Bucket** to collect your first **Water Bucket**.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/filling_cauldron.jpg" 
    alt="Filling Cauldron" 
    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

## Obtaining Lava

To generate lava, you’ll need a **Crucible**. It converts **Cobblestone** into **Lava** over time.  
The Crucible must be placed above a **heat source** — such as a Torch, Campfire, Fire, or Lava.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/crucible_torch.jpg" 
    alt="Crucible Heat Source" 
    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

| Heat Source                  | Strength |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| Lava / Flowing Lava          | 4         |
| Soul Fire / Torch / Campfire | 4         |
| Fire                         | 3         |
| Campfire                     | 3         |
| Magma Block                  | 3         |
| Torch                        | 1         |

Stronger heat sources speed up the conversion.  
Feeding 4 Cobblestone into the Crucible will slowly generate 1 bucket of Lava.

You can also interact with the Crucible using a **Water Bucket** to instantly create **Obsidian**,  
useful for early Nether access.

  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/crucible_obtaining_obsidian.jpg" 
    alt="Crucible with Lava" 
    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

## Crafting the Crucible

To craft a **Crucible**, you’ll need **4 Bricks** and **3 Mud Bricks**.  
Bricks are made by smelting **Clay**, which you can obtain by **sieving Sand**.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/recipe_crucible.jpg" 
    alt="Crucible Recipe" 
    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

To make Mud Bricks, start by creating **Mud**:  
place **Dirt** and use a **Water Bottle** on it to convert it.

Then combine the Mud with **Wheat** to make **Packed Mud**.  
Use 4 Packed Mud in a Crafting Table to create **1 Mud Brick**.  
Wheat Seeds are obtained by sieving **Dirt**.

Once you have both **Bricks** and **Mud Bricks**, craft your **Crucible**.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/mud_process.jpg" 
    alt="Mud and Packed Mud Process" 
    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

With a stable source of **Water** and **Lava**, you’ve unlocked the foundation for energy generation and automation.  
Next, we’ll move toward creating **Cobblestone Generators** and understanding **early power systems** in UtilityCraft.
