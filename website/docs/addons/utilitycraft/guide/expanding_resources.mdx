# Expanding Your Resources

After mastering your first **Sieve** and **Hammer**, it’s time to scale up and expand your resource generation.  
This section focuses on efficiency — faster sieving, better meshes, and preparing for the next stage of automation.

---

## Scaling Up Sieving

To gather more materials efficiently, you can place **multiple Sieves** next to each other in a **5x5 grid**.  
Up to **25 Sieves** can work simultaneously, allowing you to process entire stacks of Gravel or Dirt at once.  
Each Sieve works independently but can use different meshes, letting you mix drop types.

    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

The next tier of mesh is **Flint**, crafted using **Gravel**.  
Collect extra Gravel early — it will be essential for faster progression and better drop chances.

## Gathering More Wood

Wood is crucial for crafting and expanding your sieving stations.  
One of the best ways to get large amounts quickly is by **sieving Dirt** until you obtain **Jungle Saplings**.  
Jungle trees are tall and dense, giving you far more wood than normal ones.

To make things even easier, you can craft an **AIOT** (All-In-One Tool).  
When sneaking, it activates **Tree Capitation**, letting you break entire trees instantly.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/using_tree_capitator.jpg" 
    alt="Using Tree Capitation with AIOT" 
    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

Still, manual farming takes time… and that’s where **Bonsais** enter the stage — your first step toward **automated tree farming**.

## Upgrading Meshes

Once you have a steady resource flow, it’s time to **upgrade your meshes**.  
Higher-tier meshes significantly increase your chances of getting rare ores and unique drops.  
Each tier refines the results, giving more efficient yields per block.

Mesh progression goes as follows:

- **String Mesh**  
- **Flint Mesh**  
- **Copper Mesh**  
- **Iron Mesh**  
- **Gold Mesh**  
- **Emerald Mesh**  
- **Diamond Mesh**  
- **Netherite Mesh**

Each tier improves the range of resources obtainable from Gravel, Dirt, and Sand.  
Upgrade progressively as your world expands to ensure a continuous flow of valuable materials.

## Compressed Resources

To speed up production, you can **compress materials** like Cobblestone and Gravel.  
Compressed blocks can then be hammered or sieved for faster bulk processing.

The fastest method involves crafting **Compressed Cobblestone**, hammering it into **Compressed Gravel**,  
and continuing until you reach **Compressed Sand**.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/crushing_compress_cobblestone.jpg" 
    alt="Compressed Cobblestone, Gravel, and Sand" 
    width="70%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

This process saves time and inventory space, helping you prepare for large-scale sieving and the upcoming use of **machines and generators**.

With stronger meshes, efficient tree farming, and compressed materials,  
you now control the pace of your progression.  

From here, you’re ready to move beyond manual labor and into **automation** —  
the true heart of UtilityCraft.
