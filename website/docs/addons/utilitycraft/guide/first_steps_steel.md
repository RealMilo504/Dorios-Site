# First Steps to Steel

You’ve mastered resource gathering, water and lava production, and cobblestone generation.  
Now it’s time to take your **first steps into metallurgy** — creating **Steel**.  
This marks the beginning of your transition into the **Machinery Era**.

## Crafting the SmeltFlare

To start producing Steel, you’ll need **Raw Iron**, **Coal**, and a new item called the **SmeltFlare**.  
The SmeltFlare lets you combine raw materials directly in your inventory to craft metal alloys.

    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

But wait — **Paper?**  
To obtain it, sieve **Dirt** to get **Sugar Cane**, then craft it into **Paper**.  
You’ll need this to complete your SmeltFlare recipe.

## Creating Brute Steel

Once you have a SmeltFlare, place it in your inventory along with **Raw Iron** and **Coal**.  
The SmeltFlare will merge them into **Brute Steel**, a raw alloy that can later be refined.

    alt="Brute Steel Recipe" 
    width="60%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

Once you’ve made Brute Steel, smelt it in a **Furnace** or use another **SmeltFlare** to produce **Steel Ingots**.  
Tip: Combine 9 Brute Steel into a **Brute Block** to smelt 9 ores at once — this speeds up the process dramatically.

## Crafting the Workbench

Before diving into advanced machinery, you’ll need to craft a **Workbench**.  
This specialized crafting table is used to create **machines**, **generators**, and **upgrades**.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/recipe_workbench.jpg" 
    alt="Workbench Recipe" 
    width="60%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

You’re officially entering the **Machinery Era**.

## Additional Resources

Before proceeding, make sure you’ve collected:
- Enough **Steel** and **Iron** for machine crafting  
- **Copper** and **Redstone** (obtained by sieving Sand)  
- Optional: **Coal** and **Brute Blocks** for efficient smelting  

<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="/img/addons/utilitycraft/sieving_sand_resources.jpg" 
    alt="Sieving Sand for Copper and Redstone" 
    width="75%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>
