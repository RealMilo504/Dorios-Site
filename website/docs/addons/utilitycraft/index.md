# UtilityCraft

![UtilityCraft Banner](/img/addons/utilitycraft/bg.jpg)

Welcome to **UtilityCraft**, an addon pack built to turn the grind of survival into something smarter, smoother, and a lot more fun.  
Here, effort transforms into efficiency: chop less, mine less, and let machines, generators, and bonsais do the heavy lifting while you focus on the adventure.

UtilityCraft is designed with balance in mind. It won’t hand you overpowered shortcuts, but it will give you the tools to automate the boring parts, expand your resource options, and build real factory-style setups in Minecraft Bedrock.  
Think of it as your path from **basic survival** to **full automation**—without ever breaking the survival feel.

This is the first step in the series: **From Dirt to Steel**, where you’ll move from pebbles and sieves to the foundations of your first machines.

## What Does UtilityCraft Add?

UtilityCraft isn’t just one addon—it’s a bundle of systems that all connect together. You’ll find:

- **Bountiful Bonsais** – Passive farming for wood and crops.  
- **Bountiful Crops** – Grow ores and rare resources in fields.  
- **Cobblestone Generators** – Infinite cobble, from basic iron speed up to blazing netherite.  
- **Mechanical Spawners** – Customizable mob farming.  
- **Dorios' Basics** – Core blocks, recipes, and progression tools.  
- **Fluid Tanks** – Store and move huge amounts of liquids.  
- **Paxels & AIOTs** – Multi-tools to save space and time.  
- **Way Computer** – A step into automation and digital systems.  

Each piece on its own is useful, but together they create a complete tech progression for survival.

## Core Features

UtilityCraft is built around a few core systems that tie everything together:

- **Energy System**  
  Everything runs on Dorios Energy (DE). You’ll generate power with furnaces, lava, sunlight, and more, then store it in batteries and feed it into your machines.  

- **Machines**  
  Crushers, infusers, presses, furnaces, harvesters, and more. Each machine has upgrades to speed it up, make it more efficient, or expand its range.  

- **Item Transportation**  
  Move items with improved hoppers, uppers, and automation blocks, or go advanced with conduits and exporters.  

- **Blocks and Items**  
  From compressed cobblestone to special crafting components, UtilityCraft introduces new building blocks and crafting materials that push progression forward.  

- **Mechanics**  
  New farming systems, bonsai growth mechanics, mob spawning tweaks, liquid generation, and more—all designed to slot naturally into Minecraft’s survival loop.  

- **Useful Recipes**  
  Tons of new recipes and tweaks so that resources and progression always feel smooth.

## Progression Path

UtilityCraft is all about **gradual progression**. You’ll start small and build up:

1. **Early Game** – Pebbles, sieves, and flint tools.  
2. **Resource Farming** – Bonsais, cobblestone generators, and crops.  
3. **First Steps to Steel** – Craft steel with SmeltFlare and unlock the Workbench.  
4. **The Machinery Era** – Begin crafting machines, generators, and setting up energy systems.  
5. **Automation** – Link machines together, automate resource chains, and design your own survival factory.  

This way, every step feels earned and every upgrade unlocks something new.
