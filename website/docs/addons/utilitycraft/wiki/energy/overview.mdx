# Dorios Energy System

Dorios Energy (DE) is the main power source used by all machines and generators in UtilityCraft.  
It allows players to automate tasks and operate advanced blocks that require power instead of fuel.

## What Is Dorios Energy (DE)

Dorios Energy is a numeric unit that represents how much energy a block can create, store, or use.

- It is measured in **DE/t**, which means *Dorios Energy per tick*.  
- Minecraft runs at 20 ticks per second, so 20 DE/t = 400 DE per second.  
- The same system is used across all UtilityCraft machines and generators, so they work together easily.  

Every machine in UtilityCraft relies on DE to function. If a machine runs out of energy, it stops working until it is recharged.

## How Energy Is Produced

Energy is mainly created through **generators**. Each generator converts a specific resource into Dorios Energy.

| Generator | Fuel Type | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Furnator | Solid fuels such as coal, charcoal, and wood | Burns fuel items to produce a steady amount of energy. |
| Magmator | Lava | Uses lava to create a stronger and longer energy output. |
| Thermo Generator | Heat sources | Produces energy when placed near hot blocks like magma or fire. |
| Solar Panel | Sunlight | Generates energy during the day depending on light level. |

Each generator comes in four tiers: **Basic**, **Advanced**, **Expert**, and **Ultimate**.  
Higher tiers generate more energy per tick and store more internally.

Generators can directly power machines placed next to them, or send energy into a battery for later use.

## How Machines Use Energy

Machines consume DE to perform their tasks.  
Each machine has a fixed energy cost for its operation or uses energy gradually while active.

Examples:
- **Crusher** uses 800 DE for each item processed.  
- **Electro Press** uses 800 DE per operation.

</p>

Machines automatically pull energy from a connected generator or battery, as long as one of their six sides touches it.

When a powered machine is broken, it keeps the energy stored inside, so you can move it without losing progress.

## Energy Transfer

Energy in UtilityCraft can move in two main ways: **direct contact** or through **energy cables**.

When two energy blocks are touching on one of their six faces (top, bottom, front, back, left, or right), energy will automatically transfer between them.  
However, the recommended setup is to use **energy cables**, which make connections cleaner and more flexible for complex builds.

Rules for transfer:
- Generators send energy at their full output rate.  
- Batteries transfer energy at their own transfer speed.  
- Machines receive energy automatically from any connected cable or power source.  
- Batteries cannot transfer energy directly to other batteries; a cable or machine must be between them.

Using cables helps keep your network organized and allows longer-distance connections between machines and generators.

Wireless energy transfer will be added in a future update, allowing power sharing without physical connections.

## Energy Storage

Energy can be stored in **batteries** for later use.  
Batteries act as buffers that keep energy when generators are off or when machines are disconnected.

Each tier of battery holds more energy and transfers it faster.  
More details about battery types and capacity are explained in the **Battery section**.

Dorios Energy is the foundation of UtilityCraftâ€™s power network.  
Understanding how it works will help you design efficient setups, connect your machines correctly, and avoid power shortages.
