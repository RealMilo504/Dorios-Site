The **Way Center** allows teleportation to **Way Carpets** placed throughout the world,  
offering a fast and convenient way to travel between important locations.

### Overview

The Way Center enables players to link **Way Carpets** and travel instantly between them.  
Once a carpet is activated, you can teleport back to the Way Center, allowing seamless travel networks.

### Machine Information

| Setting | Value |
|----------|--------|
| **Energy Usage** | None |
| **Teleportation Cost** | Consumes XP based on distance |
| **Cross-Dimensional Travel** | Supported (with additional XP cost) |

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The farther the distance, the more **XP** it consumes.  
Cross-dimensional teleportation increases the cost even more.

## Setup Guide

To begin, you'll need to craft a **Way Carpet** and a **Way Chip**.

1. **Place the Way Carpet** at the destination you want to teleport to.  
2. **Use the Way Chip** on the carpet to link it.  
3. **Set a custom name** for the teleport point when prompted.  
4. Return to the **Way Center** and insert the **linked chip**.  

Once completed, youâ€™ll be able to teleport to and from that location as long as you have enough XP.

### How It Works

- The **Way Center** reads all inserted **Way Chips** and displays them in the teleportation menu.  
- Select the linked destination to teleport instantly.  
- Teleportation cost increases with distance and dimension change.  
- The system is entirely XP-based, requiring no energy input.

### Example Setup

| Component | Function |

| **Way Center** | Main teleportation hub |
| **Way Carpet** | Remote teleport point |
| **Way Chip** | Links the destination to the hub |

ðŸ’¡ Combine multiple Way Carpets across your base or world to create a fast-travel network.
