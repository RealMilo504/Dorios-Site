The **Seed Synthesizer** is a UtilityCraft machine that simulates crop and tree growth from **Bountiful Bonsais** and **Bountiful Crops**,  
allowing automated farming without the need for space or manual harvesting.

---

### Machine Information

| Setting | Value |
|----------|--------|
| **Energy Cap** | 128,000 DE |
| **Energy Cost** | Varies by crop type and soil |

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The Seed Synthesizer uses the same loot tables as Bountiful Bonsais and Bountiful Crops,  
allowing seamless integration between both systems.

### Usage Examples

| Seed | Soil | Result |
|--------|------|---------|
| Oak Sapling | Grass Block | Grows tree loot |
| Wheat Seeds | Red Soil | Produces wheat faster with less DE |

## Growth Costs by Crop Type

| Crop Type | Energy Cost per Cycle |
|------------|------------------------|
| Trees, Vanilla Crops, Bamboo, Cactus, Kelp, Sugar Cane, Mushrooms | 32,000 DE |
| Bountiful Crops Tier 1 | 64,000 DE |
| Bountiful Crops Tier 2 | 128,000 DE |
| Bountiful Crops Tier 3 | 256,000 DE |
| Bountiful Crops Tier 4 | 1,024,000 DE |

ðŸ“Œ Higher-tier crops require significantly more energy to simulate growth.

---

## Speed Upgrade Scaling

| Speed Level | Speed Multiplier |
|--------------|------------------|
| 0 (No Upgrades) | x1 |
| 1 | x2 |
| 2 | x4 |
| 3 | x8 |
| 4 | x16 |

**Formula:**  
`Rate Speed = Base Rate * Soil Speed Multiplier * 2^(Speed Level)`

---

## Soil Effects on Growth & Energy Cost

| Soil Type | Energy Cost Multiplier | Speed Multiplier |
|------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Dirt | 2x | 0.5x |
| Grass Block | 1.5x | 1x |
| Yellow Soil | 1x | 1x |
| Red Soil | 0.75x | 2x |
| Blue Soil | 0.5x | 4x |
| Black Soil | 0.25x | 10x |

ðŸ“Œ Better soils reduce energy cost and significantly boost growth speed.

### How to Use

1. Place the **Seed Synthesizer** in your world.  
2. Insert a **seed or sapling** in the upper slot.  
3. Insert the **soil** in the lower slot.  
4. Ensure enough stored energy for the crop type.  
5. *(Optional)* Add **Speed Upgrades** to increase growth rate.
