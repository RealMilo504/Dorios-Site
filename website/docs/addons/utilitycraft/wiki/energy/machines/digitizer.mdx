### Crafting Recipe

## How It Works

Uses a standard **3Ã—3 crafting grid**, just like a crafting table.  
It accepts any **vanilla** or **custom recipe** from the **Workbench**.

- Requires a **Blueprint** and **some energy** to function.  
- Once activated, it saves the selected recipe onto the Blueprint.  
- The stored Blueprint can then be used by the **Assembler** for automation.

---

### Blueprint

The **Blueprint** stores the recipe information below its name, showing both the **crafted item** and its **required materials**.

    alt="Blueprint Example" 
    width="60%" 
    style={{ borderRadius: "12px", boxShadow: "0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)" }}
  />
</p>

### How to Use

1. Place the **Digitizer** in your world.  
2. Insert a **Blueprint** in the designated slot.  
3. Arrange a valid recipe in the **3Ã—3 crafting grid**.  
4. Activate the Digitizer to **record** the recipe.  
5. The saved Blueprint can now be inserted into the **Assembler** for automated crafting.
