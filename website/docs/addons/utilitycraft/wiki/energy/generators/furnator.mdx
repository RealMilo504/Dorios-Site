    <p>
      The <b>Furnator</b> is a generator that produces <b>Dorios Energy (DE)</b> by burning solid fuels.  
      It is designed as an early-game power source and can be upgraded through multiple tiers for higher energy output and storage capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Furnator is simple to use — insert a valid fuel item, and it will begin generating energy automatically.

## Tiers and Power Output

Each Furnator tier increases both the rate of energy production (DE/t) and internal energy storage.  
Higher tiers are more efficient, requiring less fuel to produce the same or greater energy output.

| Tier | Output Rate (DE/t) | Internal Capacity (DE) |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Basic | 40 DE/t | 48,000 DE |
| Advanced | 160 DE/t | 192,000 DE |
| Expert | 640 DE/t | 768,000 DE |
| Ultimate | 4,000 DE/t | 4,800,000 DE |

## Accepted Fuels and Energy Produced

The Furnator accepts almost any solid fuel item, including vanilla materials and some UtilityCraft items.  
Different fuels generate different amounts of Dorios Energy depending on their efficiency.

| Fuel | Energy Produced (DE) |
|------|-----------------------|
| Quadruple Compressed Coal Block | 80,000,000 |
| Triple Compressed Coal Block | 8,000,000 |
| Double Compressed Coal Block | 800,000 |
| Compressed Coal Block | 80,000 |

## User Interface

The Furnator includes a simple interface that shows the remaining fuel, energy generation rate, and stored Dorios Energy (DE).  
Players can open the UI by interacting with the block.

- **Fuel Slot:** Place the burnable item here.  
- **Energy Bar:** Displays current stored DE.  
- **Output Rate:** Shows current generation speed in DE/t.
