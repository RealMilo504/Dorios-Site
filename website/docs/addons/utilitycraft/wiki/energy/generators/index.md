# Generators

Generators are blocks that produce **Dorios Energy (DE)** using different types of resources.  
Each one works under specific conditions and can be upgraded through multiple tiers, increasing both energy output and storage capacity.

## Available Generators

- [**Furnator**](./furnator): Generates energy by burning solid fuels such as coal or wood.  
- [**Magmator**](./magmator): Uses liquid fuels like lava to create continuous energy.  
- [**Thermo Generator**](./thermo_generator): Produces energy from heat sources such as lava, fire, or magma blocks, requiring water for cooling.  
- [**Solar Panel**](./solar_panel): Converts sunlight into energy passively during the day.

Each generator provides a unique method of energy generation suited for different setups.  
All generators support the same tier progression: **Basic**, **Advanced**, **Expert**, and **Ultimate**.
