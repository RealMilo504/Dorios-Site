# Welcome to the Wiki

This wiki brings together **every piece of detailed information** about our add-ons and packs — what they are, how they work, how to craft and use them, and the technical data that’s often hard to find elsewhere.  
The goal is to make sure you can **play, build, and debug confidently**, without jumping between scattered sources or incomplete guides.

> Current status: **in development**.  
> Pages and sections will continue to expand as documentation progresses.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Complete system explanations**: blocks, machines, energy networks, item and fluid transport, and unique mechanics.  
- **Step-by-step guides**: from the early game to late-game automation.  
- **Recipes and components**: base materials, crafting chains, and efficient routes.  
- **Technical data**: extraction rates, energy usage, processing time, capacities, limits, and multipliers.  
- **Hard-to-find tables**: mesh drop chances, crop growth times, soil bonuses, machine ranges, and upgrade costs.  
- **Compatibility notes**: integration between Dorios add-ons and third-party content, requirements, and good practices.  
- **Troubleshooting and FAQ**: common issues, causes, and verified solutions.

## How It’s Organized

- **Guide** – The recommended route for learning and progression.  
- **Core Systems** – Energy, generators, machines, item transport, and fluids.  
- **Add-ons** – Dedicated pages for each module with its own guide and technical breakdowns.  
- **Recipes & Components** – Intermediate items, crafting chains, and progression shortcuts.  
- **Third-Party Compatibility** – How to extend or integrate UtilityCraft with other add-ons.  
- **Version Notes** – Major changes that affect progression or compatibility.  
- **Troubleshooting** – Quick answers and diagnostic steps.

## Level of Detail

Every page aims to cover three key layers:

1. **What it is** – The purpose and concept of each block, machine, or system.  
2. **How it’s used** – Interfaces, inputs, outputs, and in-game examples.  
3. **Technical data** – Exact numbers and limits for optimization (I/O per tick, consumption, capacity, process duration, ratios).

Where applicable, you’ll also find:

- **Process flows** – Visual or written chains showing how inputs turn into outputs (e.g. Cobblestone → Gravel → Dirt → Sand).  
- **Design recommendations** – Stable setups, common bottlenecks, and safe expansion tips.  
- **Performance impact** – Notes for low-end devices, chunk loading, and entity management.

## Wiki Conventions

To keep everything consistent across documents:

- **Units**
  - Energy: `DE/t` (per tick) and `DE` (stored total).  
  - Fluids: `mB` (millibuckets).  
  - Speed: `u/s` (units per second) or `op/t` (operations per tick).  
- **Tiers and Upgrades** – Always listed in ascending order, with measurable effects.  
- **Probabilities** – Drop rates are expressed as percentages, and when helpful, shown per 1,000 samples.  
- **Compatibility Notes** – If a block accepts items from other add-ons, format and restrictions will be specified.

## Recipes and Format

- Recipes will include **illustrated screenshots** and, when relevant, **alternative variants**.  
- If a recipe produces multiple outputs or has ratios, it will include a small table with values.  
- **Progression shortcuts** (such as “brute” blocks that accelerate processes) will be documented separately.

## Pages in Progress

The wiki is a work in progress, and new material will be added continuously.  
Planned sections include:
- Getting started, resource gathering, and progression.  
- Detailed pages for generators, machines, and conduits.  
- Complete tables for meshes, crops, and bonsais.  
- Compatibility procedures and integration examples.  
- Troubleshooting cases and technical references.

---

## How to Use the Wiki

1. Start with the guide if it’s your first playthrough and you want structured progression.  
2. Use the technical pages when you need **exact numbers** for automation or optimization.  
3. Check compatibility notes before mixing multiple add-ons or creating modpacks.  
4. Return to the tables whenever you need **drop rates, timings, or capacities**.

---

## Versioning and Compatibility

- Each page will indicate the **game and add-on version** it applies to.  
- If a future update changes rates or recipes, a visible note will appear on the affected page.

## Development and Contributions

- The wiki will grow iteratively, prioritizing the areas most requested by the community.  
- If you find missing data or want to suggest topics, please share your feedback through the usual channels.
